## Description

This is a node app that links a note taking app with a server using express to save and load a users stored notes.

I couldn't get this app to work for me for some reason.  Just too many weird errors to get through them all, and I wasn't able to find much information on using inquirer or mySQL in this fashion.  

I was able to flesh out most of the architecture and get the addDepartment function to work.  I was working on the addRoles function when it became clear I wasn't going to debug the errors before the project is due.
